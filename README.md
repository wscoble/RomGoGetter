# RomGoGetter v0.18

**ROM curator and downloader for archive.org, lolroms.com, Minerva, and local collections. It helps you to download only the roms you want from larger romsets.**

RomGoGetter started as a 1G1R tool — pick the best regional variant of each game and skip the rest. It has since grown into a full ROM curation pipeline: pull no-intro and redump listings from multiple repositories, apply smart filtering to build exactly the collection you want, then download or copy only what's needed.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- tkinter (included with most Python distributions)
- `aria2c` — required for Minerva/Myrient downloads
- `cloudscraper` — required for Eden/EmuReady compatibility (`pip install cloudscraper`)
- `rapidfuzz` — optional but strongly recommended for Top N matching speed (`pip install rapidfuzz`)

---

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/shokoe/RomGoGetter
cd RomGoGetter
python RomGoGetter_v0_17.pyw
```

Currently tested only on Windows.

## Usage Examples

### Basic 1G1R download from archive.org

1. Setup tab
  a. Paste or select an archive.org collection URL(s) into **Source URLs / Local Dirs**
  b. Set a **Destination** folder
  c. Click on GoGet!
2. Selection tab
  a. Choose a **Mode**: `1G1R English only`
  b. Review selection and add or remove specific roms
  c. Click on **Cmopatibility** to filter by emulator compatibility lists or go straight to **Download**
3. Compatibility tab
  a. Choose the correct emaulator and click on **Fetch**
  b. Deselect groups by cards or use **Deselect below**
  c. Click on Download
4. Download tab
  a. Modify downdload settings
  b. Click on **Start**
5. Make coffeee and gaze at the dowloads ;)

### Top N by size budget

1. Set source URL(s) and destination
2. Set Mode to `Top N`
3. In the Selection tab, select source, platform, and **Max size GB**
4. Click **Fetch & Apply** — pages are fetched one at a time, full 1G1R selection is run after each page, and fetching stops as soon as the budget is reached
5. Click **Download**

### Smart copy from local collection

1. Paste your existing ROM directory path into **Source URLs / Local Dirs** (enable **Recursive** if files are in subdirectories)
2. Set **Destination** to a new folder
3. Click **GoGet!** — local files appear in the list with exact sizes
4. Apply Top N or 1G1R filtering, then click **Download** to copy selected files

### Eden (Switch) compatibility

1. Go to the **Compatibility** tab
2. Select **Eden (Switch)** as emulator
3. Click **Fetch Compatibility** — fetches from EmuReady, paginated, best score per title across all device reports
4. Requires `cloudscraper` (`pip install cloudscraper`)

### Minerva/Myrient

1. Paste a Minerva browse URL
2. This uses the bundled `aria2c.exe`
3. A torrent warning banner is shown as a reminder to seed via a proper torrent client

---

## Sources

- **archive.org** — fetches the file listing from any public (or credentialed) Internet Archive collection; supports S3 keys for access-restricted collections; works with "show all" and zip content pages
- **lolroms.com** — scrapes file listings and direct download URLs from category pages, including Wayback Machine snapshots
- **Minerva / Myrient** — downloads individual files from collection torrents via a full `aria2c` wrapper
- **Local directory** — paste a local folder path directly into the Source URLs input (one per line); local files are preferred over remote when the same filename exists in both. Enables using RomGoGetter as a **smart copy tool**: curate a large local collection down to a filtered subset in a new folder. Enable **Recursive** to scan subdirectories
- **Multiple sources at once** — paste multiple URLs and/or local paths (one per line); listings are merged into a single pool before filtering

---

## Selection

### 1G1R
The core mode. For each game title, picks one ROM: English preferred, highest revision, most language tracks. Excludes demos, kiosk builds, betas, prototypes, and non-game discs automatically.

### Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `1G1R English only` | One ROM per game, English/Western regions only, prefers multiple languages |
| `1G1R` | One ROM per game, best available region |
| `All files` | Every game ROM file selected |
| `None` | All files shown, none pre-selected — toggle manually |
| `DAT` | Cross-reference against a No-Intro / Redump DAT local or remote file; matched files selected, unmatched shown as missing |
| `Top N` | Filter by a ranked game list — see below |

### Top N
Fetches a ranked list of games from various well-known external source and maps them to your ROM pool using fuzzy/token title matching, then applies 1G1R within each matched group.

**Filter options:**
- **Top N** — take the N highest-ranked games
- **Min score** — take all games above a score threshold
- **Max size GB** — limit selection by cumulative size

### DAT Group
Apply multiple DAT files simultaneously (local paths or URLs). Useful for cross-referencing against a curated list spanning several platforms or sets.

### Bulk selection shortcuts
| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `+` | Select all visible rows (doesn't touch others) |
| `-` | Deselect all visible rows (doesn't touch others) |
| `🕸` | Select visible, deselect everything else |

### Manual override
Double-click any file in the Selection tab to toggle it in or out of the download queue. The selected size card updates live.

### Missing files
A title is shown as **Missing** (red `✗`) when it was matched to a ROM in the file listing but that ROM is not available — not present in the local source and not found remotely. Missing rows cannot be selected.

## Download

- **Parallel slots** — up to 20 simultaneous downloads, adjustable live while downloading
- **Resume** — partial `.part` and torrented files are resumed automatically on retry
- **Stuck detection** — configurable idle timeout cancels and retries hung connections
- **Verification before skipping:**

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `Overwrite` | Always re-download |
| `Name` | Skip if file exists |
| `Size` | Skip if file exists and size matches |
| `Hash` | Skip if MD5 matches archive.org metadata; falls back to size; slow |

- **Local copy** — files sourced from a local directory are copied instead of downloaded, skipped if destination size already matches
- **Minerva torrents** — uses `aria2c` to fetch individual files by torrent index without downloading the full archive; temp torrent files are cleaned up after
- **Export DAT** — export the current selection as a No-Intro compatible DAT file

---

## File layout

```
RomGoGetter_v0.17.pyw        # main script
aria2c.exe                   # required for Minerva downloads (Windows)
RomGoGetter_settings.json    # auto-created, persists all settings
RomGoGetter_groups.json      # auto-created, persists URL groups
RomGoGetter_dat_groups.json  # auto-created, persists DAT groups
```

## Indexer service (headless)

This fork also exposes a Torznab + Transmission RPC service that runs headless in a container. Discoverable by Questarr, Sonarr, and Radarr. See `indexer/README.md`.

```bash
# Local dev
nix run .#indexer
# Or with pythonEnv
RGG_API_KEY=changeme python -m indexer.server
```

Smoke test:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9696/api?t=search&q=Bomberman&apikey=test-key'
```

---

## Deployment

The `scripts/` directory holds two helpers:

- `scripts/questarr-cleanup.sh` — removes non-RomGoGetter indexers and qBittorrent downloaders from a Questarr install (API or DB mode)
- `scripts/questarr-cleanup.sh discover` — best-effort guess of where Questarr lives (k3s, docker, podman, common DB paths)

## v0.18 Updates
- Minor fixes

---

## v0.17 Updates
Added compatebility check step for leading emulators!

### Selection Tab
- **Search now supports glob and regex** — plain text = substring match, `*`/`?` wildcards = glob, any regex special character (`.`, `+`, `[`, etc.) = regex
- **`+` / `-` / `🕸` bulk selection buttons** — `+` selects all visible rows in the current search, `-` deselects them (without touching rows outside the search), `🕸` selects only visible rows and deselects everything else
- **`Source URLs / Local Dirs`** — the URL input now accepts local directory paths alongside archive.org URLs, one per line; mixed sources are merged into a single pool
- **Recursive checkbox** — when enabled, local directory scans walk subdirectories; otherwise only the root is scanned

### Top N Mode
- Optimized matching speed

---

## v0.16 Updates
- Added support for TeknoParrot latest rom selection. The english only option doesn't work (and will not) so use the regex field to filter out Japan releases with `^(?!.*\(Japan\))`. You can also filter only the newest by year (i.e since 2020 - `20[2][0-9]`)

## v0.15 Updates
- Parallel fetch in setup
- Faster metadata fetch from IA
- Fixed a major IA URL bug that caused 404 error on download
- Font size controls
- Major site added to 'Top N' with genre selection support
